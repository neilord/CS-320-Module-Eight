How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

This means ensuring that the application is working properly and is secure at the same time. To make sure that the application is working as expected and there are no security vulnerabilities, thorough testing is needed, secure coding is used, and regular reviews are performed. Writing several unit tests ensures that individual components are working as expected. For instance, in Project One, I developed unit tests, namely ContactTest.java and ContactServiceTest.java, to test the functionality of the contact management system. In addition to functionality, other practices like proper input validation, error handling, and ensuring that sensitive data is not hardcoded help prevent vulnerabilities. Static and dynamic analysis tools can also detect security risks, and regular updates contribute to keeping the system secure.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

To understand user needs, it is important to interact with stakeholders and communicate effectively. In Project Two, I worked through the project requirements to identify which features and functionalities would be most important to the users. Creating user stories or personas helps understand how users will engage with the software. Once these needs are identified, they are converted into precise and verifiable requirements that guide the development process. Iterative feedback loops, like presenting prototypes or test versions to users, are another way of fine-tuning. I paid attention to these requirements and incorporated feedback into the solution to ensure it met what the users wanted.

How do I approach designing software?

In my approach to software design, I always start by identifying the problem and defining the requirements. The process begins with developing a high-level architecture that outlines the major components of the system, the relationships between them, and the dependencies that exist. For example, in the projects, I applied an object-oriented approach to designing the contact management system to foster modularity and reusability of components. Next, I ensure that I define strong interfaces and ways that allow for growth. To do this, I use UML diagrams, flowcharts, or pseudocode to identify potential issues in the design before they occur. At all stages of the process, I use the simplest approach so the code is easy to maintain and meets the project requirements.
